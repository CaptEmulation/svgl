required libraries:
------------------
freetype 2.x (http://www.freetype.org)
png (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png)
opengl
mesa (especially OSMesa) is required for svg2raster(1) (http://www.mesa3d.org)
GLU is required. We recommend to use SGI's implementation, available
at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/. Tip: you don't need to compile the GL implementation,
so don't bother installing XFree sources. Just follow SGI instructions as if you have
them, make World, and the libGLU.so should be here.
glft (which comes along with svgl)

procedure:
---------
O. build glft and make sure it works, but don't install it.
1. decompress svgl.tgz. For example, in /home/zidane/src
2. svgl can (must ? didn't test it) be compiled in a build directory, different from the src. This is the recommended way. For example /home/zidane/build/svgl.
3. if configure in /home/zidane/src/svgl does not exist, create it by running ./build/make/bootstrap in /home/zidane/svgl
4. cd into /home/zidane/build/svgl
5. run /home/zidane/src/svgl/configure
or something like:
env "PATH=/home/zidane/build/glft:$PATH" ~/src/svgl/configure

6. make scripts
7. make

additionaly you can:
make lib (no contrib)

download the svg tests suite, and try:
make supertest

there is a tutorial as well...

there is no installation procedure so far: do not try 'make install'

FAQ
---

1. There seems to be lacking headers
svgl building procedure generates headers from the w3 idl in the directory gen/ in the build directiry. 
check wether /home/zidane/build/svgl/gen exists, if .../gen/svgl and .../gen/src exist, and if the compiler flag point to this
directory (-I/home/zidane/build/gen)
You can regenerate headers with a "make scripts"

2. What about antialiasing ?
you have to open a suitable visual. With glut, pass GLUT_MULTISAMPLE to glutInitDisplayMode.
